Brief Introduction

My name is Azeez Ibrahim Akinkunmi from University of Ibadan. I am a 400L student of computer science department.
ABOUT CODING
I write java very well, I love java especially for mobile development. I write some php/css too. i dont like javascript at all because of the stress that comes with it (you just can get the errors on your codes except through proper viewing of codes line by line)

I dont have any favourites emoji. I love challenges and also working on new things. I like multi tasking myself too.
